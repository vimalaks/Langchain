ERROR : while trying to deploy in render as webservice it keeps scanning for port
 No open ports detected, continuing to scan...
 So the deployment remains incomplete

 FIX 1 : In your render.yaml, change type: web to type: worker
 FIX 2 : setting it up manually on Render:
          a) Choose "Background Worker" instead of "Web Service" when creating the service
          b) Use python app.py as the start command.
 FIX 1 didnt help 
 FIX 2 may work but render.com doesnt provide free instance to the background worker jobs
