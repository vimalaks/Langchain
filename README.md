✅ 5. Deploy on Render
Go to https://render.com

Fill in the settings:
Environment: Python 3
Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt
Start Command: python app.py
Add the GROQ_API_KEY in the Environment Variables section.

✅ 6. Enivironment Variable

Add Enivirnment varible 
GROQ_API_KEY             xxxxxxxxxx

ERROR : while trying to deploy in render as webservice it keeps scanning for port
 No open ports detected, continuing to scan...
 So the deployment remains incomplete

 FIX 1 : In your render.yaml, change type: web to type: worker
 FIX 2 : setting it up manually on Render:
          a) Choose "Background Worker" instead of "Web Service" when creating the service
          b) Use python app.py as the start command.
 FIX 1 didnt help 
 FIX 2 may work but render.com doesnt provide free instance to the background worker jobs

 ✅ Using github Actions
 ADD API KEY @ https://github.com/vimalaks/Langchain/settings/secrets/actions
 https://github.com/vimalaks/Langchain/settings/ => secrets and variable => actions => New Repository Secredt add the Key and Value => Add secret
 Create file https://github.com/vimalaks/Langchain/.github/workflows/run.yaml
 
run.yaml
 name: Run Groq Script
on:
  workflow_dispatch:  # allows manual run via GitHub UI
jobs:
  run-script:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run script
        env:
          GROQ_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.GROQ_API_KEY }}
        run: python app.py
 Find and click "Run Groq Script" under "workflows" in https://github.com/vimalaks/Langchain/actions
 choose run workflow
 Once the run is complete it gives red or green status
 If green click it on then on the left on "summary"=> "jobs"=>"run script"
 It gives step by step display out of which choose "run script" it gives the console output

 TIPS: Github Actions good for deployment in "non-interactive" environment
 Not suitable for coding developement or interactive production space.
 
 ✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅ BEST METHOD ✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅
 ✅ Using github codespaces
 It is cloud environment where it provides VS code based dev environment and terminal
We can go to https://github.com/vimalaks/Langchain => code =>codespaces
It provides dev set up in cloud.
All code we checkin github from local will have to "git pull" in code space
another method cntrl+shif+P (command Palatte) codespaces: Rebuild container => doesnt pick updated git code
API_KEY storage =>github homepage top right -> settings -> codespaces -> Secrets -> new Secret
Here add the API key and value and the choose the specific repository in your profile for access.
